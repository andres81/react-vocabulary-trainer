## Introduction

Although not necessarily build solely for ReactJS, the examples are ReactJS projects.
They are easily started by a __*npm install*__, followed by __*npm run start*__.

The idea of this trainer, is to load five elements into the human shortterm memory, which is
about the size of 5-7 slots. By having the participant guessing, and not punishing, there is
only positive feedback. But also, very fast repetition of the material to memorize.

The exercise implemented by this tool, serves the purpose of getting material quickly into
memory, although shortterm, to be then used by other exercises to bring it into
medium and after that longterm memory.
